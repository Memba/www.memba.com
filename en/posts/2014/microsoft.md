Memba has long been a Microsoft shop and we used to be a Microsoft ISV and Microsoft partner. 
Our development team has had experience with Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual J++ and Visual Studio .NET including C#.
This is long gone for the following reasons.

### Microsoft's lack of commitment

We did a fairly large development in Visual J++ using Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) and SQL Server and when Microsoft ditched Visual J++
we lost a lot of money migrating to Tomcat and Oracle.

As object oriented development gurus, we were not big fans of HTML which we thought was clumsy at [separating concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).
When Microsoft released Silverlight, we saw many benefits in this technology, but Microsoft ditched Silverlight and at that stage we promised ourselves: NEVER AGAIN!

### Open Source

In the meantime open source took developers by storm, led by Java, MySQL and Linux communities. Java's promise to "write once, run anywhere" was not really fulfilled especially in the browser,
but Linux guaranteed that Java could run on any server size from a [PI zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) to a [zSeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_z). 

### Cloud Services

Developers now have to build for cloud services, especially Amazon AWS. We no more care about hardware, which has made [Wintel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel) completely obsolete
except for running Microsoft Office. Amazon AWS is essentially a Linux runtime environment and if one would not want a Linux development environment, especially when needing Microsoft Office
and Adobe Creative Suite, [Apple OSX](http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/) is the closest development environment one can get. 
 
### Mobile devices

Mobile devices are essentially iOS and Android and Microsoft has lost this war too.

### The MEAN stack

The [MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)) has not only reconciled us with HTML.
We finally have one single language, [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)), to build code for browsers and servers.
