We already had a web site and this replaces it.

This is great news and we are really excited about it because:

1. Our new [blog software](https://github.com/Memba/Memba-Blog) is a minimal version of the Kidoju [MEAN architecture](http://www.memba.com/en/posts/2014/12/mean).
2. It is deployed on [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), with multiple [docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, [nginx](http://nginx.org/) proxies and an AWS load balancer.

In other words, we have turned this web site into a test lab to bullet proof our Kidoju architecture and deployment before release.

Apart from the benefits of such test lab, we have built a new blog software for several reasons:

1. Considering our extensive use of [Kendo UI widgets](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui), customizing [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.com/), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) or [Ghost](https://ghost.org/fr/) to our UI design guidelines was not an easy task;
2. If we are found of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), rebuilding the web site when content changes is too constraining.
3. We like [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Github](https://github.com/) offers a great environement to write and version markdown files. 

We have made our [blog software](https://github.com/Memba/Memba-Blog) free to use for everyone.
